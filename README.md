# EarnX-Moonbeam
EarnX-Moonbeam is a Telegram bot developed by EarnX team with the aim of helping Moonbeam community keep track of their balances, delegations and other variables of the blockchain. It's very common to verify your wallet address twice a day to check if the delegation rewards was distributed or even if you already have enough balance to bond more. Using EarnX-Moonbeam bot you can easily receive these notifications wherever you stay. 

As part of the EarnX-Moonbeam bot launch, we will run a lottery for EarnX delegators and the winners will get 50 GLMR as a weekly prize. The campaign will last 4 (four) weeks! 

Please find the bot on Telegram as @earnx_moonbeam_bot .

**List of commands:**

1. /start: initialize the bot;
2. /help: list of the available commands;
3. /set num address: register a wallet with the num id;
4. /balance num: shows the balance of a wallet address with the id num;
5. /list: lists the wallet addresses registered;
6. /lottery num: subscribe in the lottery the wallet address associated with de id num;
7. /alarm-balance num value: configure an alarm that will trigger in threshold value to the wallet address associated with de id num;

You need to use the /set command to associate the id num (1 to 5) to your wallet addresses, so you can refer them on the other bot commands.

## Lottery rules

Each EarnX delegator that subscribe to the lottery using the EarnX-Moonbeam bot will have a to participate in the weekly prize of 50 GLMR. The subscription must be done every week independently. The winner will be announced every sunday on the EarnX-Moonbeam github.
